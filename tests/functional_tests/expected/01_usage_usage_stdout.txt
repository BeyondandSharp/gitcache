usage: gitcache [-h] [--version] [-c] [-u] [-d MIRROR] [-s] [-z]

gitcache
========

Local cache for git repositories to speed up working with large repositories
and multiple clones.

Without any arguments, this command prints the current configuration. Using
the listed options below, the output can be changed and special actions can
be triggered.

If called with the first argument 'git' or when called as 'git' using a symlink,
it acts as a wrapper for the git command and intercepts the commands required
for the mirror handling.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --version             Print the version of gitcache.
  -c, --cleanup         Remove all outdated repositories.
  -u, --update-all      Update all mirrors.
  -d MIRROR, --delete MIRROR
                        Delete a mirror identified by its URL or its path in the cache. This option can be specified multiple times.
  -s, --show-statistics
                        Show the statistics.
  -z, --zero-statistics
                        Clear the statistics.
